[{"content":"So, you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to begin learning Go, but you\u0026rsquo;re not too sure how to get started. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve gone through the \u0026ldquo;A Tour of Go\u0026rdquo; but now you want to set up your own environment for you own machine. Well, in the sections below you can find out how to do just that and get ready to start programming your own projects.\nThe following is applicable to Windows installations, but similar instructions may be found in the official Go Docs for other operating systems.\nDownloading and Installing The first thing we need to get started are some download files. The Go Windows installer file (.msi) can be found at the following URL:\nhttps://golang.org/dl/\nOnce downloaded, run this file and make a mental note of where the Go files have been stored in your system (Without any change, this should be C:\\Go by default).\nWith the installation complete, you should be able to open up a cmd or Powershell terminal and use the following commands:\n go version go env  Having run \u0026ldquo;go env\u0026rdquo;, you should find that GOROOT is equal to the installation directory for Go.\nIf that isn\u0026rsquo;t the case, you may need to manually change this using the \u0026ldquo;go env -w GOROOT=\u0026rdquo; command.\nIf the command wasn\u0026rsquo;t recognised, you may need to manually go into the environment variables (Settings / System and Security / System / Advanced System Settings / Environment Variables) and add the install directory\u0026rsquo;s bin folder to the system PATH variable. Restart your terminal and the commands should now work Creating a Go Workspace To create your new Go workspace we first need to create a folder to have it in. You can make this anywhere and call it anything you like.\nThis folder is where we\u0026rsquo;re going to store all of our projects in neat folders. Let\u0026rsquo;s try making one now to test that everything is installed and working as expected. You should have the following directory sturcture for each project we create:\nGo Workspace\r\r Project  build out pkg res src  main       \r\r'use strict';\rvar containerId = JSON.parse(\"\\\"2f1fae64fca20e72\\\"\");\rvar containerElem = document.getElementById(containerId);\rvar tabLinks = null;\rvar tabContents = null;\rvar ids = [];\rif (containerElem) {\rtabLinks = containerElem.querySelectorAll('.tab__link');\rtabContents = containerElem.querySelectorAll('.tab__content');\r}\rfor (var i = 0; i 0) {\rtabContents[0].style.display = 'block';\r}\r The main folder can be renamed to anything you like, but for all of our projects, this is where our code to be run is going to be placed. Let\u0026rsquo;s make that file now by adding a .go file to main, which I\u0026rsquo;ve named run.go.\nMaking our Go Builder Now, Go is what is known in the business as a compiled language. That is, the computer cannot actually understand raw Go code and needs a translator to help. This is what we\u0026rsquo;ll be using to make our programs and run them in a consistent way.\nIn our \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo; folder, we make a new text file named \u0026ldquo;build.bat\u0026rdquo; and place the following code inside it, replacing \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;run\u0026rsquo; as appropriate for you:\n1 2 3 4 5  SET GOPATH=%cd%\\.. :again go build -o ../out ../src/main/run.go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; START ../out/run.exe set /p response=Rerun? if \u0026#34;%response%\u0026#34; equ \u0026#34;\u0026#34; cls \u0026amp; goto again   Testing Our Installation Now we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start running some Go code, you can go ahead and place the following code into your \u0026ldquo;run.go\u0026rdquo; file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Hello, Go\u0026#34;) }   Finally, just double click on your build.bat file.\nIf everything has gone to plan, you should now see the words \u0026ldquo;Hello, Go\u0026rdquo; appearing at the top of your command terminal that has appeared. You can also simply press enter to re-run the code!\nCongratulations, you\u0026rsquo;ve just successfully installed Go and run your first program, taking your first, somewhat arduous steps into working with this exciting language. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, setting up your environment is easily one of the most unintuitive parts of working with Go. It may not seem like much, but it won\u0026rsquo;t be long now before you\u0026rsquo;re programming like a pro.\n","description":"How to set up your own Go environment on Windows","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["Go","Setup","Beginner"],"title":"Getting Set Up With Go","uri":"https://magpieprogramming.com/posts/go-setup/"},{"content":"What is Magpie Programming? Magpie Programming is a programming blog focusing on providing follow-along material through which you can learn new languages, become hardened veterans of their more obscure features and develop useful and interesting projects with all you\u0026rsquo;ve learned.\nThese projects vary massively in duration and difficulty, from a short 30-minute introductory command-line tool, through to series-length tutorials with the ability to make a program your own through further reading sidenotes.\nWhich Languages? Although longer projects on the blog will be focused on specific languages due to development constraints, we aim to produce various tutorials in the following languages:\n Go Java Python  How can I keep up to date?
